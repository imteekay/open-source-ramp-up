# Day 1: Component, PureComponent, and JSX

The component and the pure component are very similar. PureComponent "inherits" from Component to get all the prototype methods it defines.

I wanted to understand how the JSX works too. It's basically a function defined in the `ReactJSXElement` and `ReactElement` files.

The idea behind this function is to transform this:

```javascript
function Foo() {
  return <div />;
}
```

Into this:

```javascript
import {jsx} from "react";
function Foo() {
  return jsx('div', ...);
}
```

The [RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md) describes the idea behind it.

## Questions

  The prototype has an `updater` called `ReactNoopUpdateQueue`. It is an object, but the functions only call the function `warnNoop`, that doesn't do much. Where are the functions' implementation?

  Where does the transformation from `HTML` tags to `jsx` function happen?
</summary>

It's a babel plugin called [@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx/). It gets the jsx and transform into react functions.

This:

```javascript
const profile = (
  <div>
    <img src="avatar.png" className="profile" />
    <h3>{[user.firstName, user.lastName].join(" ")}</h3>
  </div>
);
```

Into this:

```javascript
import { jsx as _jsx } from "react";
import { jsxs as _jsxs } from "react";

const profile = _jsxs("div", {
  children: [
    _jsx("img", {
      src: "avatar.png",
      className: "profile",
    }),
    _jsx("h3", {
      children: [user.firstName, user.lastName].join(" "),
    }),
  ],
});
```
