# Open Source Ramp Up

> An idea I was thinking about was projects ramp up. At work, I constantly need to learn new codebases when changing teams or when I change jobs. But I never actually did the same thing with open source. I'm running an experiment called Open Source Ramp Up. The idea here is to get different open source projects and read the code. As I read, I understand, I have questions, and I document every part of this process.
