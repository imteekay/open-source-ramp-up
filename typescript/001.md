# 001: Scanner

The `scanner.ts` has a `ts` namespace. It provides some APIs. The first thing I read was the `Scanner` interface. A bunch of functions type definitions.

Then we have the `textToToken`. It's basically a mapper to map a text to a specific token. For example, a `";"` maps to `SemicolonToken` syntax kind. A SyntaxKind is an enum for all the language grammar. It lives in the compiler `types.ts`.
